# CS50 Final Project - Robo.Inc
 
The project is an android app made using Android Studio, where your job is to make 1 Decillion dollars (10^33).

## How do you make that money?
 
The idea is simple, you sell robots. On the homepage there are four buttons. The top right one is used to gather materials to build robots. ![Homepage](url)
The top left one uses two materials to builds one robot. Great, so now you have a robot, but what are you supposed to do with it? 

Easy, if you go to the bottom left you'll see a button with a billboard on it. When you click it your hype will go up. The higher your hype the faster you sell robots. But beware, hype will slowly go down over time so be sure to keep an eye on it. But wait, how do I check all of my inventory. If you look up you'll see five different numbers. The top one is your money and then from left to right it's robots, hype, materials, and science  (we'll talk about that later). 

## Automation 
Now if you move on to the next page you'll see lots of different autoclickers which can all be used to speed up your money making process.
You'll quickly realise that there doesn't seem to be any hype autoclickers. That's because you have to keep your hype up on your own. Now that that's out of the way we can continue. On each of the autoclickers infobox you'll see an image corresponding to the autoclicker's type. It also contains it's name, price, gather rate, and the amount of them you have. The price will increase every time you buy one. The gather rate is per second. It also gives you the abilaty to buy one or ten autoclickers at a time.

## Laboratory
if you move on to the next page you'll see that there are three different rectangles. Each one corresponds to a different upgrade. Thare are three difrent upgraade paths and each one has multiple upgrades. There are lots of different upgrades but if you want to know them all you'll have to play the game.
