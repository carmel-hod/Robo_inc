# CS50 Final Project - Robo.Inc
 
The project is an android app made using Android Studio, where your job is to make 1 Decillion dollars (10^33).

## How do you make that money?
 
The idea is simple, you sell robots. On the homepage there are four buttons, the top right one is used to gather materials to build robots. 
The top left one uses up two materials and builds 1 robot. Great so now you have a robot, but what are you supposed to do with it. 

Easy, if you go to the bottom left you'll see a
button with a billboard on it, if you click it your hype will go up. The higher your hype the faster you sell robots. But beware hype will slowly go down over time so be sure to
keep an eye on. But wait how do I check all of my inventory Well if you look up you'll see 5 different numbers the top one is your money and then from left to right it's robots, 
hype,materials, and science  (will talk about that later). 

# Automation 
Now if you move on to the next page you'll see lots of diffrent autoclickers which can all be used to speed up your money making process.
you'll quikly realise that there does'nt seem to be any hype autoclickers, that's because you have to keep your hype up on your own. Now that that's out of the way we can continue, on each of the autoclickers infobox
